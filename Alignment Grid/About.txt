SKIN ALIGNMENT ASSISTANCE GRIDS

A set of 5 grid patterns to assist in aligning skins relative screen positions.

Three Horizontal/Vertical grid patterns measured in either Pixels, Centimeters, or Inches 
A Circular grid pattern measured in pixels
And Aspect grid (perspective toward a selectable vanishing point)

This is a collaboration of:
* An idea by Ivan
* A solution provided by Balala
* And expansion by suggestions from Ivan, Balala, & Eclectic Tech
* Coding by Eclectic Tech & Balala
 
Description
Alignment Grid was created to help you position multiple skins symmetrically on the screen.

Five modes are provided:
Pixel - H/V grid spaced in pixels
CM - H/V grid spaced in centimeters
IN - H/V grid spaced in inches
Circle - Concentric circles spaced in pixels
Aspect - Perspective toward a selectable vanishing point

Aligning vertically or horizontally is fairly easy, but this tool will allow more precision relative positioning and spacing.

The Circle mode is especially useful for arched alignment along a curve.
The grids provide center lines (in a different color) and additional 45 degree diagonals in Circle mode.

- ADDENDUM -
These example images don't have any background so pattens dominant.
You can use the grids with/without a wallpaper to align skin to that image.
